### Codex Notes:
I'v forked Lsp Saga to use it in my old machine(Debian 11) and my NeoVim is not nightly(leatest versioan),
thus many super features of lspsaga won't work on older nvim versions, and there are error messages displayed,
so in this fork I'm trying to make lspsaga silent as possible and enjoying with its reset features that
work well with older nvim version.
That's it, `(>^.^<)` vim
